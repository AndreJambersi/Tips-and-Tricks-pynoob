# Tips-and-Tricks-pynoob
I made this repository to place some code fragments that can help me with some random problem with Python.

Its just a bunch of code fragments for Python with a fast explanation of what they do.
Probably they are just simple or begginer stuff, but help me a lot!

I still don't upload anything, but I will soon!
